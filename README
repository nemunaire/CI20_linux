This is the Linux Kernel repo for the MIPS CREATOR CI20.

It is based on the 3.18.3 stable branch.

The jump between 3.0.8 and 3.18.3 is very big and quite significant. 
DO NOT replace them as is and expect everything to work!

Read the wiki [1] for differences and what to tweak in your OS before attempting a kernel upgrade.

Some patches are on their way upstream.

Others need tweaking/reworking/consolidation with existing drivers before they can be sent upstream.
