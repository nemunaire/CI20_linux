* Ingenic JZ4740 ADC

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "ingenic,jz4740-adc"
- reg: Should contain the address & length of registers
- interrupts: Should specify the interrupt provided by parent.
- clocks: Should contain a single clock specifier for the ADC clock.
- clock-names: Should be "adc".

Example:

adc@0x10070000 {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-adc";
	reg = <0x10070000 0x30>;

	interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	interrupts = <18>;

	clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_SADC>;
	clock-names = "adc";
};
