Ingenic JZ4780 SoC Low power Control Register regulator driver

Required properties:
- compatible: "ingenic,jz4780-lcr"
- reg: LCR register address
- regulators: A node that houses a sub-node for each regulator controled by the
  register. Each sub-node is identified using the node's name (or the deprecated
  regulator-compatible property if present), with valid values listed below.
  The content of each sub-node is defined by the standard binding for
  regulators; see regulator.txt.

The valid names for regulators are:

  SCPU, VGU, GPU, GPS

Example:

	lpcr: lcr@0x10000004 {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-lcr";
		reg = <0x10000004 0x4>;
		
		regulators {
			vpu_power: VPU {
			};
			gpu_power: GPU {
			};
			gps_power: GPS {
			};
		};
	};
