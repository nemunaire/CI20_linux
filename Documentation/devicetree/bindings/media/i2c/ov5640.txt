Omnivision 5Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Omnivision OV5640 is a CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with an active
array size of 2592H x 1944V. It is programmable through a simple two-wire serial
interface.

Required Properties:
- compatible: value should be "omnivision,ov5640"
- core-supply: phandle to regulator for core 1.5V
- analog-supply: phandle to regulator for analog 2.8V

Optional Properties:
- gpio-enable: handle to GPIO connected to enable pin
- gpio-reset: handle to GPIO connected to reset pin

For further reading on port node refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

	i2c_master {
		ov5640@0x3C {
			compatible = "omnivision,ov5640";
			reg = <0x3C>;

			core-supply = <&vcim1v5_reg>;
			analog-supply = <&vcim2v8_reg>;

			gpio-enable = <&gpb 18 0>;
			gpio-reset = <&gpb 26 0>;

			remote = <&pxa_camera>;
			port {
				ov5640_1: endpoint {
					bus-width = <8>;
					remote-endpoint = <&pxa_camera>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
