Ingenic jz4780 SoC EHCI controller binding

The Ingenic jz4780 SoC includes an EHCI compliant USB host controller
interface for use with USB 2.0 devices.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "ingenic,jz4780-ehci".
 - reg: Should contain the address & size of the EHCI controller registers.
 - interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle of the interrupt controller that
   delivers interrupts to the EHCI block.
 - interrupts: Should specify the interrupt provided by interrupt-parent.
 - clocks: Should contain a single clock specifier for the jz4780 UHC clock.
 - ingenic,vbus-gpio: Should be a gpio-list specifying the GPIO used to drive
   VBUS.

Example SoC include file:

/ {
	ehci: jz4780-ehci@13490000 {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-ehci";
		reg = <0x13490000 0x10000>;

		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		interrupts = <20>;

		clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_UHC>;
	};
};

Example board file:

&ehci {
	ingenic,vbus-gpio = <&gpf 15 0>;
};
