* Ingenic JZ47xx MMC controllers

This file documents the device tree properties used for the MMC controller in
Ingenic JZ47xx SoCs. These are in addition to the core MMC properties described
in mmc.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of the following:
  - "ingenic,jz4740-mmc" for the JZ4740
  - "ingenic,jz4780-mmc" for the JZ4780
- reg: Should contain the MMC controller registers location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the interrupt specifier of the MMC controller.
- clocks: Clock for the MMC controller.

Optional properties:
- vmmc-supply: phandle to regulator handling power for mmc

Examples:

  msc0: msc@13450000 {
    compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-mmc";
    reg = <0x13450000 0x1000>;

    interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
    interrupts = <37>;

    clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CGU_CLK_MSC0>;

    bus-width = <4>;
    cd-gpios = <&gpf 20 1>;

    vmmc-supply = <&regulator_power>;

  };
